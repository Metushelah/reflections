When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  if you work on several computers and/or want to save it to a secure place

Why might you want to always pull manually rather than having Git automaticlly stay up to date with your remote repository?
	so that it wont override your own changes before you were able to commit them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks are used for copying a repository you cannot change.
	clone is for copying a repository you can change.
	branching is for dividing your work into seperate groups.
		you would fork when you want to copy someone else's work
		clone when you copy whatever repository you need.
		branch when you want to experiment.
